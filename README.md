## User Stories
I've been programming since my senior year of high school in AP Computer Science. Since then, I've had a huge interest in the components of creating and understanding the programming and computer science. However, I've had a difficult time making project and standing out from the rest of the crowd. I am determined to push that aside and make a difference using this class as a resource to advance my learning in computer science.

4.) Making the application work with currencies of different number of strings.
5.) Which process in the application should be appropriate to store the data in the local database.
