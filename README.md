## User Stories
I've been programming since my senior year of high school in AP Computer Science. Since then, I've had a huge interest in the components of creating and understanding the programming and computer science. However, I've had a difficult time making project and standing out from the rest of the crowd. I am determined to push that aside and make a difference using this class as a resource to advance my learning in computer science.
